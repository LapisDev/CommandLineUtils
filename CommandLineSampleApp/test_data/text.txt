Verse Inspired by "Farewell on the Ancient Grassland"
Bai Juyi
Lush, lush grass on the plain,
Once every year it sears and grows.
Wildfire can not burn it out,
Spring breeze blows it back to life.
Distant scent invades the ancient path,
Sunny green joins the arid towns.
Another send-off to our wanderlust son,
Sad, sad leave-taking exuberant.
